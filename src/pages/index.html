<p>It's the last week of May, which means a Bank Holiday weekend in the UK with a small chance of good weather. For us -- it also means something else. This weekend will mark two years since the first commit to the OSMC project which started it all.</p>

<h2>Just a 2nd title</h2>

<p>The project was formerly called <em>linXBMC</em> and the goal was to support more hardware platforms than <em>Raspbmc</em> and improve upon the foundation that <em>Raspbmc</em> provided. It then took one year of hard work for us to reach a <a href="https://osmc.tv/2015/06/osmc-announces-its-stable-release/" target="_blank">final, stable version of OSMC</a>. We've been busy ever since.</p>

<h3>Just a 3rd title</h3>

<p>We wanted to thank all OSMC users, developers and everyone that helps make the project better every day. There's a lot of work and improvements going on behind the scenes, and in a few weeks we'll let you know more about the changes.</p>

<p>We'd love for you to celebrate with us and to say thank you, we're offering 10% off everything in the <a href="https://osmc.tv/store">OSMC Store</a> to celebrate our Birthday Weekend.</p>

<p>Here's to another year!</p>
